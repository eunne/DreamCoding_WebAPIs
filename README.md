# WebAPIs
## Review

<br/>

This is my firsttime to write down HTML with JS code, 'cause I've practiced algorithm and data structure.

When I wrote down codes with JS, I thought 'What is it? it's.. a kind of different from what I studied?'<br/>
That's becuase I didn't study on parts of Event, Promise, Ajax, Browser etc.. yet.

Collecting new knowledge makes me thrilled, though.

<br/>


## What I learned

<br/>

* webAPIs list : https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API

* Event handler : ./Note_Eventhandler.md 
* Window/Brower size
